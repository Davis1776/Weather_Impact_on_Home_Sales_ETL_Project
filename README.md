Title: Does Weather in Indiana Impact If and When a Home Is Sold?

Aims:

•	AIM 1: Evaluate existing data from the Indiana Property Disclosure datasets.

•	AIM 2: Analyze data for weather, home sales, and Census data to find correlations within each dataset. 

•	AIM 3: Design tables and utilize Open Weather Map (API), Kaggle (CSV), U.S. Census (API). 

•	AIM 4: Uitilize Analysis tools such as: Json | Python

•	AIM 5: Provide data on if weather impacts the home sales in Indiana.


Impact and Intended Results

The Hoosier State that is proud to have all four seasons of the year. No matter what time of year it is, you’ll find something fun to do outdoors thanks to our Midwestern location. It’s often mild enough that golfers can play into late fall or early winter, but snow skiers can still hit the slopes in the winter. Hiking is fun whatever season, and when the summer sun shines brightly it’s a great time to hit a water park, baseball game or zoo.

Lately Indiana has been one of the top growing cities in the United States. Since Indiana experiences all four seasons, the question on the table is to discover how weather impacts this growth. 

Our goal is to provide the impact of home sales in Indiana based on weather. We will look at dates, temperature changes, conditions, buyer location per county, sale prices, population count, head income and medium home value. 

Average Temperatures

As you might guess, January is typically the coldest month and July the hottest. Here are average temperatures for each month.

The Plan

Extraction - Extract: your original data sources and how the data was formatted (CSV, JSON, pgAdmin 4, etc).
Open Weather Now (API)
Indiana Home Sales (Kaggle csv)
U.S. Census (API)

The extracted housing related data source was the U.S. Census and was aquired using an API. The specific data set selected was from was the 2018 American Community Survey 5-Year Survey U.S. Census ACS and the data points we selected came from the following table: U.S. Census Variables

Potential Questions to Researh:
1. Does Indiana monthly temperature impact monthly growth?
2. Where in the Unites States are most people moving to Indiana from? 
3. What counties in Indiana experience the most growth per year? 
4. Which season of the year provides a decline in yearly population growth?
