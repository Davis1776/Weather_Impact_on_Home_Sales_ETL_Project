•	AIM 2: Analyze data for weather, home sales, and Census data to find correlations within each dataset. 
•	AIM 3: Design tables and utilize Open Weather Map (API), Kaggle (CSV), U.S. Census (API). 
•	Analysis tools used: Json | Python
•	AIM 4: Provide data on if weather impacts the home sales in Indiana.

Impact and Intended Results

The Hoosier State that is proud to have all four seasons of the year. No matter what time of year it is, you’ll find something fun to do outdoors thanks to our Midwestern location. It’s often mild enough that golfers can play into late fall or early winter, but snow skiers can still hit the slopes in the winter. Hiking is fun whatever season, and when the summer sun shines brightly it’s a great time to hit a water park, baseball game or zoo.


Our goal is to provide the impact of home sales in Indiana based on weather. We will look at dates, temperature changes, conditions, buyer location per county, sale prices, population count, head income and medium home value. 
Average Temperatures
As you might guess, January is typically the coldest month and July the hottest. Here are average temperatures for each month.  

Monthly Precipitation
While kids do get to enjoy snow days in Indiana, the summer months bring the most precipitation. Check out the monthly averages.
